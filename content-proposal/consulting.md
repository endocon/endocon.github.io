The following points are taken from here:

http://unbounce.com/landing-pages/7-elements-of-a-winning-landing-page/

1. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

	a. Main Headline

		- Endo Consulting

	b. Supporting Headline

	c. Reinforcement Statement

		- Creating apps that make you more money is what we do best.

	d. Closing argument

		- No harm in contacting us with an *idea*.

2. Photos/Videos

	- We should get some?

3. Benefits/Features

	- Raise your profits with a custom app and backend sever.

	- Increase conversion with a smart phone app that connects to your product
	  offerings.

	- Create an interactive in-store experience for customers to get a better
	  feel for your products.

	- ...

4. Social proof

	- (Don't really have any quotes/reviews yet...?  We should try to get some
	  from our first clients)

5. Call to action

	a. Form Header

		- Start a Discussion

	b. Explanation

		- Email us to start a discussion about how we can create an app to make
		  you more money.  We might even be able to point you towards a product

		  already exists!

	c. Call to Action Button

6. Biographies

	- Nolan

		  conversion.

	- Dennis
		* (picture)
		* Interested in distributed systems, as well as creating worry-free
		  backend systems that increase profits.

## TODO

Basically everything is still "TODO", but here are a couple things I think we
should think about before we go too far.

- Should we present ourselves as a "company", or as "two consultants: Nolan and
  Dennis"?

  - In the stuff above, I presented us as a "company" (and listed the stuff
    we've done in one list).  But we could totally split it out and list the
    stuff Dennis has done separate from the stuff that Nolan has done.

  - On one hand, presenting us as "two consultants: Nolan and Dennis" makes us
	more relatable as people (c.f. tip 3 from
	https://blog.kissmetrics.com/boost-conversions-using-images/), but
	presenting us as a company makes us more "trustable"?

  - Maybe the best would be presenting us a company, and then having a section
    with biographies for both of us?

## resources

- maybe have some sort of call to action?
